- [ ] c. Prioritizing collaboration
- [ ] d. Communicating with employees

**Answer:** **a. Applying computer forensics and b. Automating tasks with programming**

**Elaboration:**  Technical skills in the context of cybersecurity include applying computer forensics – the practice of collecting, analyzing, and reporting on digital data in a way that is legally admissible. It can be used in the detection and prevention of crime. Automating tasks with programming is another technical skill, which involves using code to create scripts or software that can automate various tasks, increasing efficiency and accuracy.

## Question 7: Security Information and Event Tools
**Question:** Fill in the blank: Security information and event _____ (SIEM) tools enable security professionals to identify and analyze threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

- [ ] a. mitigation
- [X] b. management
- [ ] c. maturity
- [ ] d. monitoring

**Answer:** **b. management**

**Elaboration:** Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware. They enable security professionals to manage security information and event logs, providing insights into activities within their IT environment. This is crucial for detecting, understanding, and responding to security incidents and threats.

## Question 8: Computer Forensics Task
**Question:** A security professional receives an alert about an unknown user accessing a system within their organization. They attempt to identify, analyze, and preserve the associated criminal evidence. What security task does this scenario describe?

- [X] a. Computer forensics
- [ ] b. Software upgrades
- [ ] c. Programming with code
- [ ] d. Resolving error messages

**Answer:** **a. Computer forensics**

**Elaboration:** This scenario describes the task of computer forensics, which involves collecting, preserving, analyzing, and presenting data from computer systems in a way that is legally admissible. This process is critical in identifying and tracking unauthorized access or other illegal activities in digital environments.

## Question 9: PII and SPII
**Question** Which of the following statements accurately describe personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII)? Select all that apply.

- [X] a. An example of PII is someone’s email address.
- [X] b. The theft of SPII is often more damaging than the theft of PII.
- [X] c. SPII is a type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines.
- [ ] d. An example of SPII is someone’s last name. 

**Answer:** **a. An example of PII is someone’s email address, b. The theft of SPII is often more damaging than the theft of PII , c. SPII is a type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines**

**Elaboration:** Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is any data that can be used to identify a specific individual. Email addresses, names, and phone numbers are examples. Sensitive PII (SPII) is information that, when disclosed, could result in harm to the individual. Examples include social security numbers or medical records. SPII requires more stringent protection due to the potential harm that may arise from its compromise.
