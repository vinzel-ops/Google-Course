## Question 1: Broken Access Controls
**Question:** An application has broken access controls that fail to restrict any user from creating new accounts, allowing anyone to add new accounts with full admin privileges. This is an example of what?

- a. A vulnerability
- b. A security control
- c. A threat
- d. An exploit

**Answer:** **a. A vulnerability**

**Elaboration:** Broken access controls in an application represent a significant security vulnerability. This flaw allows unauthorized creation of accounts, potentially granting full admin privileges to anyone. This exposes the system to various security risks, as it undermines the integrity and confidentiality of the system, making it susceptible to malicious activities.

## Question 2: Security Strategy
**Question:** What security strategy uses a layered approach to prevent attackers from gaining access to sensitive data?

- a. Caesar's cipher
- b. Triple DES (3DES)
- c. Defense in depth
- d. Kerchoff’s principle

**Answer:** **c. Defense in depth**

**Elaboration:** Defense in depth is a strategic approach that employs multiple layers of security controls and defenses throughout an information system. This method ensures that if one layer fails, additional layers continue to provide protection, making it more challenging for attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.

## Question 3: Firewall in Defense Model
**Question:** An organization's firewall is configured to allow traffic only from authorized IP addresses. Which layer of the defense in depth model is the firewall associated with?

- a. Application
- b. Network
- c. Data
- d. Endpoint

**Answer:** **b. Network**

**Elaboration:** Firewalls, especially when configured to restrict traffic based on IP addresses, primarily function at the network layer of the defense in depth model. They are instrumental in creating a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks, controlling the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

## Question 4: Purpose of CVE® List
**Question:** What is the main purpose of the CVE® list?

- a. To create a dictionary of threats to organizational assets that must be addressed
- b. To provide organizations with a framework for managing cybersecurity risk
- c. To share a standard way of identifying and categorizing known vulnerabilities and exposures
- d. To keep a record of the coding mistakes of major software developers

**Answer:** **c. To share a standard way of identifying and categorizing known vulnerabilities and exposures**

**Elaboration:** The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE®) list is a publicly available catalog of known security vulnerabilities and exposures. Its purpose is to provide a standardized method for identifying and categorizing these vulnerabilities, facilitating the sharing of data across various security tools and services.

## Question 5: Preparing New Workstations
**Question:** A security team is preparing new workstations for office installation. Which vulnerability management steps should they take? Select three answers.

- a. Install a suite of collaboration tools on each workstation.
- b. Consider who will be using each computer.
- c. Configure the company firewall to allow network access.
- d. Download the latest patches and updates for each system.

**Answer:** **b. Consider who will be using each computer, c. configure the company firewall to allow network access and d. Download the latest patches and updates for each system, and one other option.**

**Elaboration:** When preparing new workstations, it is crucial to consider the user's role and access needs (b), and ensure that each system is up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates (d). These steps are part of effective vulnerability management, aimed at reducing security risks in new systems.

## Question 6: Vulnerability Assessment Steps
**Question:** During a vulnerability assessment, a scanner identifies a vulnerable onsite server with an outdated operating system. What is the next step?

- a. Disregard the outdated operating system because the device is operational.
- b. Deactivate the server because its operating system is outdated.
- c. Scan the millions of devices that connect to the server.
- d. Perform a risk assessment of the old operating system.

**Answer:** **d. Perform a risk assessment of the old operating system.**

**Elaboration:** When a vulnerability assessment identifies an outdated operating system, the appropriate next step is to perform a risk assessment (d). This involves evaluating the potential threats and impacts associated with the outdated OS, leading to informed decisions about necessary security measures or updates.

## Question 7: Types of Attack Surfaces
**Question:** Which of the following are types of attack surfaces? Select three answers.

- a. Malicious software
- b. Computer workstations
- c. Cloud servers
- d. Network routers

**Answer:** **b. Computer workstations, c. Cloud servers, d. Network routers

Elaboration: Attack surfaces can include any point where an unauthorized user can try to enter or extract data. Computer workstations (b), cloud servers (c), and network routers (d) are all potential points of vulnerability where an attacker might attempt to exploit weaknesses.

## Question 8: Attack Vectors in Email Scenario
Question: A project manager receives a suspicious email with a file attachment, which installs malicious software on their laptop. What are the attack vectors used?

- a. The file attachment
- b. The malicious software
- c. The suspicious email
- d. The infected workstation

**Answer:** **a. The file attachment, c. The suspicious email**

**Elaboration** In this scenario, the attack vectors include the file attachment (a), which was the direct means of delivering the malware, and the suspicious email itself (c), which was the method used to present the malicious attachment to the target.

## Question 9: Attacker Mindset Reasons
**Question** Why do security teams practice an attacker mindset? Select three answers.

- a. To find insights into the best security controls to use
- b. To identify attack vectors
- c. To exploit flaws in an application's codebase
- d. To uncover vulnerabilities that should be monitored
**Answer** a. To find insights into the best security controls to use, b. To identify attack vectors, d. To uncover vulnerabilities that should be monitored

**Elaboration** Adopting an attacker mindset helps security teams to anticipate potential threats (b), uncover vulnerabilities (d), and gain insights into effective security controls (a). This proactive approach is essential for identifying and mitigating security risks before they can be exploited by actual attackers.

## Question 10: Evaluating App Security
## Question: As a security professional, you're evaluating the security of an educational app. What steps should you take using an attacker mindset? Select two answers.

- a. Ensure the app's login form works.
- b. Identify the types of users who will interact with the app.
- c. Integrate the app with existing educational resources.
- d. Evaluate how the app handles user data.
**Answer** b. Identify the types of users who will interact with the app, d. Evaluate how the app handles user data.

**Elaboration** To evaluate the app's security, you should identify the types of users and their interaction patterns (b), which can highlight potential risk areas. Additionally, evaluating how the app handles user data (d) is crucial for ensuring data privacy and security, especially in educational environments where sensitive student information is involved.
