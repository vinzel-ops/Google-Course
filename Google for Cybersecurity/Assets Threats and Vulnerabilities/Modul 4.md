## Question 1: Stages of Social Engineering Attack
**Question:** Fill in the blank: The four stages of a social engineering attack are to prepare, _____, use persuasion tactics, and disconnect from the target.

- [ ] a. obtain access credentials
- [X] b. establish trust
- [ ] c. distribute malicious email
- [ ] d. perform open-box testing

**Answer:** **establish trust**

**Elaboration:**  In a social engineering attack, establishing trust with the target is a crucial stage. After preparation, the attacker works to build a relationship or rapport with the target to make them more susceptible to persuasion tactics, followed by a disconnection to avoid detection.

## Question 2: Common Form of Social Engineering
**Question:** What is the most common form of social engineering used by attackers?

- [ ] a. Ransomware
- [ ] b. Malware
- [ ] c. Adware
- [X] d. Phishing

**Answer:** **Phishing**

**Elaboration:** Phishing is the most common form of social engineering used by attackers. It involves sending deceptive messages, often via email, to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, clicking on malicious links, or downloading harmful attachments.

## Question 3: Non-Malware Types
**Question:** Which of the following are not types of malware? Select two answers.

- [X] a. Cross-site scripting
- [X] b. SQL injection
- [ ] c. Worm
- [ ] d. Virus

**Answer:** **Cross-site scripting, SQL injection**

**Elaboration:** Cross-site scripting and SQL injection are not types of malware; they are types of security vulnerabilities. Cross-site scripting (XSS) involves injecting malicious scripts into webpages viewed by others, while SQL injection is a technique used to manipulate a database through unsanitized input vulnerabilities.

## Question 4: Example of Specific Attack Type
**Naration** A government contractor is tricked into installing a virus on their workstation that encrypts all their files. The virus displays a message on the workstation telling the contractor that they can have the files decrypted if they make a payment of $31,337 to an email address.

**Question:** What type of attack is this an example of?

- [X] a. Ransomware
- [ ] b. Brute force attack
- [ ] c. Cross-site scripting
- [ ] d. Scareware

**Answer:** **Ransomware**

**Elaboration:** This scenario describes a ransomware attack. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts the victim's files and demands a ransom, typically in cryptocurrency, for the decryption key. It is often spread through phishing emails or exploiting vulnerabilities.

## Question 5: Cryptojacking Explanation
**Question:** Fill in the blank: Cryptojacking is a type of malware that uses someone’s device to _____ cryptocurrencies.

- [X] a. mine
- [ ] b. earn
- [ ] c. collect
- [ ] d. invest

**Answer:** **mine**

**Elaboration:** Cryptojacking is a type of malware that covertly uses a victim's computing power to mine cryptocurrencies. The malware runs in the background, often without the user's knowledge, utilizing the device's resources for mining activities.

## Question 6: Type of Security Attack
**Naration** Security researchers inserted malicious code into the web-applications of various organizations. This allowed them to obtain the personally identifiable information (PII) of various users across multiple databases.

**Question:** What type of attack did the researchers perform?

- [ ] a. Input sanitization
- [X] b. Injection
- [ ] c. Social engineering
- [ ] d. Ransomware

**Answer:** **Injection**

**Elaboration:**  This scenario describes an injection attack, where attackers insert malicious code into a program or application, which then gets executed by the system. This type of attack can compromise data and lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information.

## Question 7: Example of Injection Attack
**Naration** An attacker injected malware on a server. When a user visits a website hosted by the server, their device gets infected with the malware.

**Question:** This is an example of what type of injection attack?

- [ ] a. Brute force
- [ ] b. Reflected
- [ ] c. DOM-based
- [X] d. Stored

**Answer:** **Stored**

**Elaboration:** This is an example of a stored injection attack, particularly a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The malware is stored on the server and then executed on the user's device when they visit the infected website.

## Question 8: Preventing SQL Injection Attacks
**Question:** Which of the following are coding techniques that can be used to prevent SQL injection attacks? Select three answers.

- [X] a. Input sanitization
- [X] b. Prepared statements
- [X] c. Input validation
- [ ] d. Public key infrastructure (PKI)

**Answer:** ** Input sanitization, Prepared statements, Input validation**

**Elaboration:** To prevent SQL injection attacks, techniques like input sanitization (removing or encoding illegal characters), prepared statements (precompiling the SQL query), and input validation (verifying user input before processing) are effective. These techniques ensure that input is safe to process, preventing attackers from manipulating SQL queries.

## Question 9: Diagram in Threat Modeling
**Naration** Pertanyaan #9
A small business that sells online courses conducted a threat modeling exercise on its data systems. The team conducting the exercise started by defining the scope of the model. Then, they identified threat actors who might target the data systems. Next, the team is creating a diagram that maps threats to assets that are being protected.

**Question** What is this type of diagram called?

- [ ] a. Bug bounty
- [X] b. Attack tree
- [ ] c. Rainbow table
- [ ] d. User provisioning

**Answer:** **Attack tree**

**Elaboration:**  In threat modeling, an attack tree is used to map threats to the assets being protected. It visually represents the potential paths an attacker might take to compromise the system, helping to identify and prioritize potential risks.

## Question 10: PASTA Threat Model Analysis
## Question: A security team is decomposing an application during a PASTA threat model. What information will they discover during this step of the process?

- [ ] a. The types of threats that can be used to compromise data
- [X] b. How the application handles data and which controls are in place
- [ ] c. Which data owners are compromising the organization
- [ ] d. The vulnerabilities that have been reported to the CVE® list

**Answer:** ** How the application handles data and which controls are in place**

**Elaboration:** In the Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA) threat model, decomposing an application involves understanding how the application handles data and identifying which security controls are in place. This step is crucial for assessing the application's security posture and identifying potential vulnerabilities.
