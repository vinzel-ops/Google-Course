- [X] a. Operational
- [ ] b. Compliance
- [X] c. Technical
- [X] d. Managerial

**Answer:** **Operational, Technical, Managerial**

**Elaboration:** Security controls can be categorized into operational, technical, and managerial controls. Operational controls involve procedures and policies that are implemented and executed by people. Technical controls are those that involve technology to protect information assets. Managerial controls involve the management's policies and procedures, guiding the organization's overall approach to security.

## Question 2: Data Owner's Authorization
**Question:** A paid subscriber of a news website has access to exclusive content. As a data owner, what should the subscriber be authorized to do with their account? Select three answers.

- [X] a. Update their payment details
- [x] b. Review their username and password
- [X] c. Stop their subscription
- [ ] d. Edit articles on the website

**Answer:** **Update their payment details, Review their username and password, Stop their subscription**

**Elaboration:**  A subscriber, as a data owner, should have the authority to manage their personal account details. This includes updating payment information, reviewing and changing their username and password, and having the option to stop their subscription as needed.

## Question 3: Email Encryption
**Question:** You send an email to a friend. The service provider of your inbox encrypts all messages that you send. What happens to the information in your email when it’s encrypted?

- [ ] a. It’s converted from ciphertext to plaintext.
- [ ] b. It’s converted from Caesar’s cipher to plaintext.
- [X] c. It’s converted from plaintext to ciphertext.
- [ ] d. It’s converted from a hash value to ciphertext.

**Answer:** **It’s converted from plaintext to ciphertext.**

**Elaboration:** When an email is encrypted, the information in the email is converted from plaintext (readable format) to ciphertext (encoded format). This process ensures that the information remains confidential and can only be read by the intended recipient who has the key to decrypt it.

## Question 4: Verifying System File Integrity
**Question:** A security analyst is investigating a critical system file that may have been tampered with. How might the analyst verify the integrity of the system file?

- [ ] a. By opening the system file in word processing application and checking its version history.
- [X] b. By comparing the system files hash value to a known, trusted hash value.
- [ ] c. By brute forcing the system file using a rainbow table.
- [ ] d. By decrypting the system files secret key using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

**Answer:** **By comparing the system file's hash value to a known, trusted hash value**

**Elaboration:** To verify the integrity of a system file, a security analyst can compare the file's hash value to a known, trusted hash value. If the values match, it indicates that the file has not been tampered with and maintains its integrity.

## Question 5: PKI Security Controls
**Question:** Which security controls are used in public key infrastructure (PKI)? Select three answers.

- [X] a. Asymmetric encryption
- [X] b. Symmetric encryption
- [ ] c. Multi-factor authentication
- [X] d. Digital certificates

**Answer:** ** Asymmetric encryption, Symmetric encryption, Digital certificates**

**Elaboration:** Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) utilizes various security controls including asymmetric encryption (for secure communication), symmetric encryption (for fast encryption of data), and digital certificates (for verifying the identity of entities).

## Question 6: Authentication Factors
**Question:** What factors do authentication systems use to verify a user's identity? Select three answers.

- [X] a. Knowledge
- [X] b. Characteristic
- [X] c. Ownership
- [ ] d. Accounting

**Answer:** **Knowledge, Characteristic, Ownership**

**Elaboration:** Authentication systems verify a user's identity based on factors like knowledge (something the user knows, like a password), characteristic (something the user is, like a fingerprint), and ownership (something the user has, like a security token).

## Question 7: Advantage of SSO Systems
**Question:** What is an advantage of using single sign-on (SSO) systems to authenticate users?

- [ ] a. Users lose access to multiple platforms when the system is down.
- [X] b. It makes the login process faster.
- [ ] c. Users must set multiple passwords.
- [ ] d. It prevents credential stuffing attacks.

**Answer:** **It makes the login process faster**

**Elaboration:** Single sign-on (SSO) systems offer the advantage of a faster login process. SSO allows users to access multiple applications or services with a single set of credentials, simplifying the authentication process and enhancing user experience.

## Question 8: Receptionist's Access to Information
**Question:** The main responsibility of a receptionist at a healthcare company is to check-in visitors upon arrival. When visitors check-in, which kinds of information should the receptionist be able to access to complete their task? Select two answers.

- [X] a. A photo ID
- [ ] b. Their billing information
- [ ] c. Their medical history
- [X] d. The patient being visited

**Answer:** **A photo ID, The patient being visited**

**Elaboration:** To complete the check-in process, a receptionist should access the visitor's photo ID for identification purposes and know the patient being visited to direct the visitor appropriately. Access should be limited to only what is necessary for the task.

## Question 9: Authorization Tools
**Question** What are common authorization tools that are designed with the principle of least privilege and separation of duties in mind? Select three answers.

- [X] a. API Tokens
- [X] b. OAuth
- [ ] c. SHA256
- [X] d. Basic auth

**Answer:** **API Tokens, OAuth, Basic auth**

**Elaboration:** API Tokens, OAuth, and Basic auth are common authorization tools that adhere to the principles of least privilege and separation of duties. They provide controlled access to resources, ensuring that users or systems have only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.

## Question 10: Investigating Unauthorized Purchase
## Question: A customer of an online retailer has complained that their account contains an unauthorized purchase. You investigate the incident by reviewing the retailer's access logs. Which component of the user's session that you might review?

- [X] a. Session cookie
- [ ] b. Session algorithm
- [ ] c. Session API key
- [ ] d. Session certificate

**Answer:** **Session cookie**

**Elaboration:** In investigating an unauthorized purchase, reviewing the session cookie can be crucial. Session cookies contain information about the user's session and can provide insights into user activities and patterns during the session in which the unauthorized purchase occurred.
